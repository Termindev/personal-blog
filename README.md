# TerminDev

This repo is for my personal website, feel free to ask me anything about approaches or why I did that or why I didn't use that and so on, as I think there will be many of such questions.

The rest of this is sveltekit's guide to development so yeah.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
